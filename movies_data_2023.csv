Its heroes are either from Buenos Aires or have developed their career there, and until recently, no one asked themselves what happened beyond it. This documentary brings back one of those ignored fragments through the figure of Carlos Procopiuk, a man who inhabited, like nobody else, the ethics and aesthetics of a cinema made in a rabidly independent way. An all-terrain character who acted, wrote, produced, edited, directed and taught his community, in Neuquén between the 1950s and the 1990s, how to make films. With the memory still fresh and the eloquent images from his works, the documentary by Diego Lumerman settles a small part of that inestimable debt that Argentine film has with its history.",1.255,['Argentina'],2023-11-05,0,65,['Español'],Released,Procopiuk,False,0.0,0
